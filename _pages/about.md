I characterize myself as an inventive, innovative and hardworking person, with a strong spirit of initiative. I’m a builder and a doer. I’m always motivated to build proofs-of-concept applications and deeply explore new trends and technologies. As a researcher, I’m mostly focused on developing and improving existing software development techniques and producing knowledge aiming to optimize software products and respective source code.

## Latest news

## Current Status

I'm currently enrolled in the MAP-i doctoral program, a joint Doctoral Programme in Computer Science at the University of Minho, the University of Aveiro, and the University of Porto. I also received a 5-year FCT grant for my Ph.D. research. 

In meantime, I'm also a researcher at HASLab (High Assurance Software Lab) and I'm also an invited assistant professor at University of Minho, Braga. I'm also a member of the Green Software Lab research lab.

## Background

I obtained my MSc degree in 2017, which was focused on Cryptography, Distributed Systems and Software Engineering. My MSc thesis was entitled “GreenSource: repository tailored for Green Software analysis” and was focused on Green Computing and Software Testing. This thesis aimed at building automatic approaches for measuring and analyzing mobile software energy consumption, by using source code analysis and manipulation techniques. 

## Main Research Interests
