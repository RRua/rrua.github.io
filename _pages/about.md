I characterize myself as a creative and hardworking person, with a spirit of initiative and motivation. I'm always seeking new challenges and learning to do things in the right way. I m always motivated to explore new trends and technologies.

## Current Status

I'm currently enrolled in the MAP-i doctoral program, a joint Doctoral Programme in Computer Science at the University of Minho, the University of Aveiro, and the University of Porto. I also received a 5-year FCT grant for my Ph.D. research. 

In meantime, I'm also a researcher at HASLab (High Assurance Software Lab) and I'm also teaching classes at the University of Minho. I am also a member of the Green Software Lab research lab.

## Background

I obtained my MSc degree in 2017, which was focused on Cryptography, Distributed Systems and Software Engineering. My MSc thesis was entitled “GreenSource: repository tailored for Green Software analysis” and was focused on Green Computing and Software Testing. It was aimed at building automatic approaches for measuring and analyzing mobile software energy consumption, by using source code analysis and manipulation techniques.
