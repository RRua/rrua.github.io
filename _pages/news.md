**November 2024**: I’m excited to share that I am joining NYU Abu Dhabi as a Postdoctoral Researcher.  

**August 2024**: I served on the Program Committee for the Artifact Evaluation track at the International Conference on Software Language Engineering (SLE AE 2024).

**August 2024**: I completed a 17-day visit to Professor Rodrigo Almeida at the University of Brasília (UnB) as part of a Short-Term Scientific Mission funded by Cerciras (CA19135). This visit focused on collaborative knowledge exchange with researchers from academia and industry and initiating a research project to evaluate the Performance Overhead of Software Tracing methods for Android applications.

**July 2024**: I presented my research at the 3rd Workshop on Resource Awareness of Systems and Society (RAW 2024) in Maribor, Slovenia. This workshop convened educators, researchers, and industry professionals to discuss solutions and challenges in resource-aware computing.

**May '24:** I am thrilled to announce that I have successfully defended my PhD thesis! My thesis, titled "Green Software in the Large: Energy-driven Techniques, Tools and Repositories" was defended at University of Minho. 

**Dec '23:** My research paper, titled "A large-scale empirical study on mobile performance: energy, run-time and memory" was published in the Volume 29 of the Empirical Software Engineering (EMSE) journal.

**Sept '23:** I am honored to announce my forthcoming participation in the 39th IEEE International Conference on Software Maintenance and Evolution (ICSME '23), scheduled to take place in Bogotá, Colombia. My purpose in attending this prestigious event is twofold: to present a research paper and to augment my knowledge within the field.

**Sept '23:** I am pleased to share that my research paper, titled "PyAnaDroid: A fully-customizable execution pipeline for benchmarking Android Applications," has been recognized with the "Open Research Object" badge as part of the Artifact Evaluation Track and ROSE Festival at ICSME '23.

**Sept '23:** I had the privilege of participating in the Cerciras Training School 2023, which was conducted in Riga, Latvia. This distinguished event congregated an array of lectures and tutorials, focusing on topics encompassing Resource Awareness in Informatics, Software Engineering, Computer Engineering, and System Usage.

**Aug 2023:** I am delighted to announce that my paper, "PyAnaDroid: A fully-customizable execution pipeline for benchmarking Android Applications," has been accepted in the Tool Demo track of ICSME 2023.

**July 2023:** I had the opportunity to attend the SusTrainable Summer School 2023, which was hosted in Coimbra, Portugal. This distinguished event featured a comprehensive program comprising lectures and tutorials, all centered around the pertinent theme of Sustainability within the realm of Information and Communication Technology (ICT).

**Feb ‘23:** I’m lecturing a Master’s Degree Course in Software Engineering named “Topics of Software Development”. The course is focused on cross-platform development techniques, mobile platform foundations and software design approaches.

**Jan ‘23:** I was invited to be a PC member of the SCORE contest @ ICSE 2023, to be held in Melbourne, Australia.

**Dec ‘22:** I was invited to be a Demonstrations and Posters Session Chair @ ICT4S 2023, to be held in Rennes, France.

**Dec ‘22:** I’ve finished my 3 month-long research internship @ NII, Tokyo, Japan. During these few months, I’ve investigated and developed autonomous methodologies to analyze and predict cryptocurrency market movements.
